# Iris - LiveKit Agent

# Iris – LiveKit Realtime Agent

Iris is the realtime LiveKit agent of the Sfinx system.

It acts as the **realtime I/O layer** for the interview experience, handling:
- Live audio input/output
- Turn-taking and speech boundaries
- Speech-to-text (STT) and text-to-speech (TTS)
- Low-latency interaction via LiveKit rooms

The name *Iris* is inspired by Greek mythology, where Iris is the messenger of the gods—reflecting the agent’s role as a realtime communication bridge between users and the AI system.

## Development Setup

Clone the repository and install dependencies to a virtual environment (Prefer to use Python 3.13, uv):

```console
cd iris
rm -rf .venv/
uv sync --python 3.13
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Sign up for [LiveKit Cloud](https://cloud.livekit.io/) then set up the environment by copying `.env.example` to `.env.local` and filling in the required keys:

- `LIVEKIT_URL`
- `LIVEKIT_API_KEY`
- `LIVEKIT_API_SECRET`

You can load the LiveKit environment automatically using the [LiveKit CLI](https://docs.livekit.io/home/cli/cli-setup):

```bash
lk cloud auth
lk app env -w -d .env.local
```

## Run the agent

Before your first run, you must download certain models such as [Silero VAD](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/turns/vad/) and the [LiveKit turn detector](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/turns/turn-detector/):

```console
uv run python src/agent.py download-files
```

Next, run this command to speak to your agent directly in your terminal:

```console
uv run python src/agent.py console
```

To run the agent for use with a frontend or telephony, use the `dev` command:

```console
uv run python src/agent.py dev
```

In production, use the `start` command:

```console
uv run python src/agent.py start
```

## Frontend & Telephony

Get started quickly with our pre-built frontend starter apps, or add telephony support:

| **iOS/macOS** | [`livekit-examples/agent-starter-swift`](https://github.com/livekit-examples/agent-starter-swift) | Native iOS, macOS, and visionOS voice AI assistant |
| **Flutter** | [`livekit-examples/agent-starter-flutter`](https://github.com/livekit-examples/agent-starter-flutter) | Cross-platform voice AI assistant app |
| **React Native** | [`livekit-examples/voice-assistant-react-native`](https://github.com/livekit-examples/voice-assistant-react-native) | Native mobile app with React Native & Expo |
| **Android** | [`livekit-examples/agent-starter-android`](https://github.com/livekit-examples/agent-starter-android) | Native Android app with Kotlin & Jetpack Compose |
| **Web Embed** | [`livekit-examples/agent-starter-embed`](https://github.com/livekit-examples/agent-starter-embed) | Voice AI widget for any website |
| **Telephony** | [📚 Documentation](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/start/telephony/) | Add inbound or outbound calling to your agent |

For advanced customization, see the [complete frontend guide](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/start/frontend/).

## Tests and evals

This project includes a complete suite of evals, based on the LiveKit Agents [testing & evaluation framework](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/testing/). To run them, use `pytest`.

```console
uv run pytest
```

## Deploying to production

This project is production-ready and includes a working `Dockerfile`. To deploy it to LiveKit Cloud or another environment, see the [deploying to production](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/ops/deployment/) guide.

## Self-hosted LiveKit

You can also self-host LiveKit instead of using LiveKit Cloud. See the [self-hosting](https://docs.livekit.io/home/self-hosting/) guide for more information. If you choose to self-host, you'll need to also use [model plugins](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/models/#plugins) instead of LiveKit Inference and will need to remove the [LiveKit Cloud noise cancellation](https://docs.livekit.io/home/cloud/noise-cancellation/) plugin.
